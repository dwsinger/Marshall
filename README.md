# Marshall
## Street planning for the Marshall traffic.

The primary concern is the stretch of Highway One from just north of the Marshall Petaluma road junction, south to Tony's; [this is a map](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/marshall-street-planning_607330 ) that has overlays and annotations that we can edit.

## Concerns

The primary concern is that all — drivers, cyclists, pedestrians — should have a safe and pleasant experience.

Specific concerns:
1. The Marshall-Petaluma road junction is invisible around a bend as drivers approach from the south, and some speed up as they perceive that they have passed Hog Island. (See photo below).
2. There is a lot of parking, cars backing into the roadway, and pedestrians walking along the roadway to/from parked cars, around the main commercial establishments: Hog Island Oysters, Marshall Store, and Tony's. (Also at Nick's, out of this area). (We hear that the dangerous pedestrian queuing along the road to shop at the Marshall Store will soon be fixed.)
3. Some of the 'danger areas' appear after long apparently-empty straight stretches and gentle bends (notably approaching Marshall Store from the south).

## Goals

1. Cause drivers to pay more attention and take more care, and slow down.
2. Enable cyclists and pedestrians to use the road while staying in their own safe(r) areas.

## Ideas

Overall: the suitable use of an effective amount of signage and road marking that will achieve the goals. We are aware that if signage gets excessive, drivers stop paying attention.

1. Improve the white-line edge-striping so that it's visible. In some parts (e.g. past Hog Island parking) it has worn away completely.
2. Replace the missing LED display 'your speed' as you approach the Marshall-Petaluma (MP) road junction from the north.
3. Keep the grass mowed on the MP junction corner to ensure that drivers exiting the MP road can see.
4. Install white stripes across the road, with decreasing spacing, to induce drivers to slow down
   * approaching the MP junction after rounding the last bend
   * approaching the Marshall Store/Post Office area
5. Install signs "Pedestrians in Roadway Next 1 Mile" at those same two locations
6. Install a sign "Blind Intersection" just south of the MP junction, facing south
7. Move the "T" sign at that location more visible (see image below)
8. Fix the broken signs (e.g. the posts opposite the MP junction have been driven into and are broken)
9. Consider pedestrian crossings, mostly to convince drivers to slow
   * at the north end of the Hog Island parking
   * other places where people park both side on Highway One (e.g. Nick's Cove?)
10. Consider center-of road plastic flexible poles at the pedestrian crossings
11. Consider edge-of-road plastic flexible poles on the road-edge white line in places where pedestrians typically walk along
   * by Hog Island Oysters west-side parking (outside their building)
   * by the Marshall store (both north and south)
12. Better separate cyclists, pedestrians, and motor vehicles by suitable markings (e.g. pedestrian or cycle lanes).
13. Cause motor vehicles to slow down by giving the perception of a narrowing in the driving lanes.

## Next steps

1. Review the proposed signage plans from Caltrans.
2. Contact the owners of the major establishments to find out what their concerns, past requests and actions, and hopes are.
3. Refine the Concerns, Goals, Ideas
4. Then meet with Caltrans and other appropriate officials to get their ideas, plans, and timelines.
