# Marshall
## Street planning for the Marshall traffic.

The primary concern is the stretch of Highway One from just north of the Marshall Petaluma road junction, south to Tony's; [this is a map that works sometimes](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/marshall-street-planning_607330 ) that has overlays and annotations that we can edit.

Consider extending the area of primary concern to south of the 35 MPH zone by the Marconi boat launch area, and north to Nick's.

## Goals

1. Cause drivers to pay more attention and take more care, and slow down.
2. Enable cyclists and pedestrians to use the road while staying in their own safe(r) areas.

## Concerns

The primary concern is that all — drivers, cyclists, pedestrians — should have a safe and pleasant experience. Some of the 'danger areas' where these populations mix appear after long apparently-empty straight stretches and gentle bends (notably approaching Marshall Store from the south).

We seek suitable use of an effective amount of signage and road marking that will achieve improvement. We are aware that if signage gets excessive, drivers stop paying attention.

## Specific ideas and issues


[#1](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/1). the road edge is collapsing (topsoil erosion) along a stretch of Highway One south of the Marshall store (see [map](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/marshall-street-planning_607330 ) for marker).

[#2](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/2) The Marshall-Petaluma road junction is invisible around a bend as drivers approach from the south, and some speed up as they perceive that they have passed Hog Island. (See photo below and in the issue). See also [#9](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/9) (consider a sign "Blind Intersection" just south of the MP junction, facing south) `maintenance`

[#3](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/3) There is a lot of parking, cars backing into the roadway, and pedestrians walking along the roadway to/from parked cars, around the main commercial establishments: Hog Island Oysters, Marshall Store, and Tony's. (Also at Nick's, out of this area). See [#8](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/8) (signs "Pedestrians in Roadway Next 1 Mile" `enhancement`) and [#10](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/10) (pedestrian crosswalks, `enhancement`)

[#4](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/4) High vehicle speed is a key safety issue; large trucks have been seen going up to 60 mph by Marshall in the mornings and during the day. See [#7](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/7) (visual rumble strips) and [#12](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/12) (traffic calming)

[#5](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/5) Improve the white-line edge-striping so that it's visible. In some parts (e.g. past Hog Island parking) it has worn away completely. `maintenance`

[#6](https://github.com/dwsinger/Marshall/issues/6) Replace the missing LED display 'your speed' as you approach the Marshall-Petaluma (MP) road junction from the north. `maintenance`

## Action the community is taking

1. The dangerous pedestrian queuing along the road to shop at the Marshall Store has been improved, through moving seating indoors etc.

## Next steps

1. Review the proposed signage plans from Caltrans.
2. Contact the owners of the major establishments to find out what their concerns, past requests and actions, and hopes are.
3. Refine the Concerns, Goals, Ideas
4. Then meet with Caltrans and other appropriate officials to get their ideas, plans, and timelines.
